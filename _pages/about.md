Hi! I'm Satyam Goyal, an incoming Masters student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, studying Computer Science. I'm excited about GenAI applications specifically making agents that can rapidly learn. I'm particularly interested in RL and self-improvement in LLMs. I've worked on exciting projects like developing an AI-based academic assistant, improving colorblind image correction algorithms, and creating benchmarks for linguistic reasoning in LLMs.

When I'm not immersed in tech, I love playing the Hindustani flute and enjoy a good game of table tennis. Thanks for getting to know a bit about me!
