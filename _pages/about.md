Hi! I'm Satyam Goyal, a junior at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, studying Computer Science. I'm passionate about machine learning and artificial intelligence, and I've worked on some exciting projects like developing an AI-based academic assistant and improving colorblind image correction algorithms. I'm aiming to build a career as a Machine Learning Engineer, using my skills in LLMs and data analysis to drive innovation.

When I'm not immersed in tech, I love playing the Hindustani flute and enjoy a good game of table tennis. Thanks for getting to know a bit about me!
